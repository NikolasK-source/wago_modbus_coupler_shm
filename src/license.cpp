    o << std::endl;
    o << "      The licenses for most software are designed to take away your" << std::endl;
    o << "    freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public" << std::endl;
    o << "    Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change" << std::endl;
    o << "    free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some" << std::endl;
    o << "    specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the" << std::endl;
    o << "    Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You" << std::endl;
    o << "    can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether" << std::endl;
    o << "    this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better" << std::endl;
    o << "    strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use," << std::endl;
    o << "    not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that" << std::endl;
    o << "    you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge" << std::endl;
    o << "    for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get" << std::endl;
    o << "    it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of" << std::endl;
    o << "    it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do" << std::endl;
    o << "    these things." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid" << std::endl;
    o << "    distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these" << std::endl;
    o << "    rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for" << std::endl;
    o << "    you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis" << std::endl;
    o << "    or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave" << std::endl;
    o << "    you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source" << std::endl;
    o << "    code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide" << std::endl;
    o << "    complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them" << std::endl;
    o << "    with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling" << std::endl;
    o << "    it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the" << std::endl;
    o << "    library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal" << std::endl;
    o << "    permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that" << std::endl;
    o << "    there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is" << std::endl;
    o << "    modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know" << std::endl;
    o << "    that what they have is not the original version, so that the original" << std::endl;
    o << "    author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be" << std::endl;
    o << "    introduced by others." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of" << std::endl;
    o << "    any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot" << std::endl;
    o << "    effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a" << std::endl;
    o << "    restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that" << std::endl;
    o << "    any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be" << std::endl;
    o << "    consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the" << std::endl;
    o << "    ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser" << std::endl;
    o << "    General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and" << std::endl;
    o << "    is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use" << std::endl;
    o << "    this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those" << std::endl;
    o << "    libraries into non-free programs." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using" << std::endl;
    o << "    a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a" << std::endl;
    o << "    combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary" << std::endl;
    o << "    General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the" << std::endl;
    o << "    entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General" << std::endl;
    o << "    Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with" << std::endl;
    o << "    the library." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      We call this license the \"Lesser\" General Public License because it" << std::endl;
    o << "    does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General" << std::endl;
    o << "    Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less" << std::endl;
    o << "    of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages" << std::endl;
    o << "    are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many" << std::endl;
    o << "    libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain" << std::endl;
    o << "    special circumstances." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to" << std::endl;
    o << "    encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes" << std::endl;
    o << "    a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be" << std::endl;
    o << "    allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free" << std::endl;
    o << "    library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this" << std::endl;
    o << "    case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free" << std::endl;
    o << "    software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free" << std::endl;
    o << "    programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of" << std::endl;
    o << "    free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in" << std::endl;
    o << "    non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU" << std::endl;
    o << "    operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating" << std::endl;
    o << "    system." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the" << std::endl;
    o << "    users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is" << std::endl;
    o << "    linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run" << std::endl;
    o << "    that program using a modified version of the Library." << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and" << std::endl;
    o << "    modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a" << std::endl;
    o << "    \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\".  The" << std::endl;
    o << "    former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must" << std::endl;

    o << "    straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is" << std::endl;
    o << "    included without limitation in the term \"modification\".)" << std::endl;
    o << std::endl;
    o << "      \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for" << std::endl;

    o << "        the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility" << std::endl;

    o << "        a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the" << std::endl;
    o << "        application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any" << std::endl;
    o << "        application-supplied function or table used by this function must" << std::endl;
    o << "        be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square" << std::endl;
